Writes an OLE document

AUTHORS: Felipe Monteiro de Carvalho

Properties of this unit for creating OLE documents:

* Can only create documents with one stream. It's not possible
  to create real directory structures like the OLE format supports.
  This is no problem for most applications.
* No limitations interfere with the creation of multi-sheet Excel files

The Windows only code, which calls COM to write the documents
should work very well.

The cross-platform code at this moment has some limitations,
but should work for most documents. Some limitations are:

* Supports only 1 stream in the file
* Fixed sectors size of 512 bytes
* Fixed short sector size of 64 bytes
* Never allocates more space for the MSAT, limiting the SAT to 109 sectors,
  which means a total
* Never allocates more then 1 sector for the SAT, so the document may have
  only up to 512 / 4 = 128 sectors

  The file is organized as following using Short Sectors:

  HEADER
  SECTOR 0 - SAT
  SECTOR 1 - Directory stream
  SECTOR 2 - Short SAT
  SECTOR 3 and on - User data

  And this SAT will describe that.

  This results in the following SecID array for the SAT:

  Array indexes 0  1  2  3 ...  N-1  N  ...
  SecID array  –3 –1 –2  4 ...  -2  -1  ...

  As expected, sector 0 is marked with the special SAT SecID (➜3.1).
  Sector 1 and all sectors starting with sector 5 are
  not used (special Free SecID with value –1).

8.4 Short-Sector Allocation Table

The short-sector allocation table (SSAT) is an array of SecIDs and contains the SecID chains (➜3.2) of all short-
streams, similar to the sector allocation table (➜5.2) that contains the SecID chains of standard streams.
The first SecID of the SSAT is contained in the header (➜4.1), the remaining SecID chain is contained in the SAT. The
SSAT is built by reading and concatenating the contents of all sectors.
Contents of a sector of the SSAT (sec_size is the size of a sector in bytes, see ➜4.1):
Offset Size Contents
0 sec_size Array of sec_size/4 SecIDs of the SSAT
The SSAT will be used similarly to the SAT (➜5.2) with the difference that the SecID chains refer to short-sectors in the
short-stream container stream (➜6.1).

This results in the following SecID array for the SSAT:
Array
indexes 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011...4142434445464748495051525354...
SecID array 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 101112...42434445–247–2–250515253–2–1...
All short-sectors starting with sector 54 are not used (special Free SecID with value –1).
