This demo shows how a large database table can be exported to a spreadsheet file
using virtual mode. 

First, run the section 1 to create a dBase file with random data.
Then, in section 2, the dBase file can be converted to any spreadsheet format
supported.

Please note that this example is mainly educational to show a "real-world"
application of virtual mode, but, strictly speaking, virtual mode would not
be absolutely necessary due to the small number of columns.
